# GeyserHacks-Fabric
A fabric port of Camotoys GeyserHacks plugin. But for fabric servers - WIP

Various workarounds for Geyser players that modify the server in order to achieve better playability.

Issues with each workaround are listed in the config! Take your time to read them as the workarounds in this mod can be used for exploitative purposes.

Fixes:

- Bamboo and dripstone collision (by setting them to no server-side collision)
- GeyserMC/Geyser#638 by letting the server control entities, just like Bedrock expects it to
