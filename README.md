# GeyserHacks-Fabric
A fabric port of Camotoys GeyserHacks plugin. But for fabric servers - WIP

done:
- mixin to disable bamboo/dripstone collision
- mixinconfigplugin
- event to listen to block placement
- add config 90%

todo:
- add itemsteerablefix
- actually check in the BlockPlaceEvent whether placing is allowed
- add magic

Note: This project isn't officially supported by Camotoy; nor is it affiliated with GeyserMC. It is designed to work with Geyser/Floodgate though.
